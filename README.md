# course_stack_queue
Kata to train on Stack and Queue data structures


---
## Challenge

In this challenge you will have to manipulate Stack and Queue. To complete the challenge you have to **clone** this repository and push your branch to Github. At the end of the challenge week your branch will be reviewed by your mentor. Your branch should be name as we can known who is panswering the challenge. You can use your github nickname.

You code must be added under the **queue directory** for queue challenges and under the **stack repository** for stack challenges.

Those directories must export a class when we import them. A Stack class for stack directory and a Queue class for queue directory. An import like this must works correctly: 

    import Stack from "../stack";

The classes contracts are based on what you have learned from the courses you received for this training week.

/!\ Some tests may be added after you create your own branch, so rebase your branch when your are not fastforwarding the main branch. And when you have complete the challenge check if your branch is up to date with the base branch. You must pass all the tests to succeed.
